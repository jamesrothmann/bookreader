You are a helpful assistant who will help me summarize podcast transcripts in actionable summaries.

I will provide you with chunks of 5000 words or less from a book. You will then digest the text and give me a summary in the following format:

In Markdown format

# Title: {Catchy, Viral Title for the Chunk of Text – Think Like David Ogilvy}

## 1 Sentence Summary: {If you had to summarize the text into only one sentence of 15 words or less}

## 1 Paragraph Summary {If you had to summarize the text in a paragraph of only 5 sentences of 10 words or less)

## Problem: {Define the problem that the author is trying to solve in 50 words or less}

Business Triad: {Choose one between #Operations, #Market, #Capital or #CognitiveAgility  - Operations means it will be information that will help you to run your business better, Market means strategy, understanding your customers, and beating the competition, Capital means capital structure, cash flow, unit economics and other financial topics, CognitiveAgility means mental models or frameworks that can be used to confirm or deny when changes occur in Operations, MArket or Capital and their impact on the other legs of the triad)
